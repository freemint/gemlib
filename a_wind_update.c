#include "gem_aesP.h"

/** manages the screen drawing semaphore.
 *
 *  @param Code specifies an action as follows:
 *  - #END_UPDATE  (0)   This mode resets the flag set by #BEG_UPDATE
 *                  and should be called as soon as redrawing
 *                  is complete. This will allow windows to be
 *                  moved and menus to be dropped down again.
 *  - #BEG_UPDATE  (1)   Calling this mode will suspend the process
 *                  until no drop-down menus are showing and no
 *                  other process is updating the screen. This
 *                  will then set a flag which guarantees that
 *                  the screen will not be updated and windows
 *                  will not be moved until you reset it with
 *                  #END_UPDATE. Generally this call is made
 *                  whenever a #WM_REDRAW message is received to
 *                  lock the screen semaphore while redrawing.
 *  - #END_MCTRL   (2)   This mode releases control of the mouse to
 *                  the AES and resumes mouse click message
 *                  services.
 *  - #BEG_MCTRL   (3)   This mode prevents mouse button messages
 *                  from being sent to applications other than
 *                  your own. mt_form_do() makes this call to lock
 *                  out screen functions. Desk accessories
 *                  which display a dialog outside of a window
 *                  must use this function to prevent button
 *                  clicks from falling through to the desktop.
 *  @param global_aes global AES array
 *
 *  @return  returns 0 if an error occurred or non-zero otherwise.
 *
 *  @since All AES versions.
 *
 *  @sa mt_wind_new()
 *
 *  As of AES version 4.0, you may logically OR a mask of
 *  #NO_BLOCK (0x0100) to either #BEG_UPDATE or #BEG_MCTRL. This
 *  mask will prevent the application from blocking if another
 *  application currently has control of the screen semaphore.
 *  Instead, if another application has control, the function
 *  will immediately return with an error value of 0. This
 *  method should only be used by timing-sensitive applications
 *  such as terminal programs in which a long redraw by another
 *  application could cause a timeout.
 *
 *  All mt_wind_update() modes nest. For instance, to release the
 *  screen semaphore, the same number of #END_UPDATE calls must
 *  be received as were #BEG_UPDATE calls. It it recommended
 *  that you design your application in a manner that avoids
 *  nesting these calls. Both the #BEG_UPDATE and #BEG_MCTRL
 *  modes should be used prior to displaying a form or popup to
 *  prevent them from being overwritten or clicks to them being
 *  sent to other applications. Always wait until after the
 *  #BEG_UPDATE call to turn off the mouse cursor when updating
 *  the screen to be sure you have gained control of the
 *  screen. Applications such as slide-show viewers which
 *  require the whole screen area (and may need to change
 *  screen modes) may call mt_wind_update() with parameters of
 *  both #BEG_UPDATE and #BEG_MCTRL to completely lock out the
 *  screen from other applications. The application would still
 *  be responsible for saving the screen area, manipulating
 *  video modes as necessary, restoring the screen when done,
 *  and returning control of the screen to other applications
 *  with #END_UPDATE and #END_MCTRL.
